Chapter I
Instructions
• The group WILL be registered to defense. Automatically. If one of of you cancels
it, there won’t be another one.
• Any question regarding the subject will probably complicate the subject.
• You have to follow the submission procedures for all your exercises.
• This subject could change up to an hour before submission.
• The program must compile with the following flags: -Wall -Wextra -Werror; and
uses cc.
• If your program doesn’t compile, you’ll get 0.
• Your program must be written in accordance with the Norm. If you have bonus
files/functions, they are included in the norm check and you will receive a 0 if there
is a norm error inside.
• You must turn in a Makefile, which will compile your project using the rules $NAME,
clean and fclean
• You must therefore do the project with the imposed team and show up at the
defense slot you’ve assigned, with all of your teammates.
• Each member of your group must be fully aware of the works of the project. Should
you choose to split the workload, make sure you all understand what everybody’s
done. During defense, you’ll be asked questions, and the final grade will be based
on the worst explainations.
• Gathering the group is your responsibility. You’ve got all the means to get in
contact with your teammates: phone, email, carrier pigeon, spiritism, etc. So don’t
bother blurping up excuses. Life isn’t always fair, that’s just the way it is.
• However, if you’ve really tried everything one of your teammates remains unreachable : do the project anyway, and we’ll try and see what we can do about it during
defense. Even if the group leader is missing, you still have access to the submission
directory.
